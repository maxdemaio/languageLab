# Language Lab

## Website description
Language Lab is a website where you can practice the conjugations of the 25 most common verbs in a target language. This allows for practical and efficient language learning, giving you a solid foundation to comprehend and converse.

### Homepage
Here is how the homepage looks. This is where one can select the target language they would like to practice
from the dropdown menu. For now, I have only populated English, but more languages can be added in the future.

### Conjugation
Afterwards, you can jump right into practice. The web application will prompt you with a subject pronoun,
verb, and tense to conjugate.

#### Correct Conjugation
If you get the conjugation correct, the view will flash "Correct" and move on
to the next conjugation.

#### Incorrect Conjugation
IF you get the conjugation incorrect, you will be given the correct response and be given the chance to
retry the conjugation.
